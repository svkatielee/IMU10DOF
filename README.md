10dof_IMU
=========

mbed lib and example for 10dof MEMS IMU from DFRobot.com for use on ST's NUCLEOF401RE.
http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/10_DOF_Sensor_%28SKU:SEN0140%29
    Adxl345 accelerometer
    ITG3200 gyro
    HMC5883L Compass
    BMP085 pressure sensor

I started with the code from Alo√Øs Wolff's HK10DOF on mbed.com
URL=http://developer.mbed.org/users/pommzorz/code/HK10DOF/

His IMU from Hobby King uses most of the same sensors as the DFRobot,
only the Gyro is different, L3G4200D instead of my ITG3200.

I modified the L3G4200D code to use the same calls and syntax but manage
the IGT3200.

I also corrected a few discrepencies. I2C bus frequency, initialize variables and 
data types. It seems either mbed or the NUCLEOF401RE are very picky about type mismatch.

So I have initialized this repository with the orignal core from mbed and 
then commited my changes.

The main.cpp is a demo program to exercize the library. It was compiled off-line from mbed 
using makefile. Makefile is left for reference from the mbed archive. I setup locally by following 
instructions from Adam Green here: https://github.com/adamgreen/gcc4mbed  and here: https://github.com/adamgreen/gcc4mbed/blob/master/notes/porting.creole#readme

I used information on this page http://blog.bitify.co.uk/2013/11/using-complementary-filter-to-combine.html
to understnd and debug this code. The gunplot was especially helpful.
